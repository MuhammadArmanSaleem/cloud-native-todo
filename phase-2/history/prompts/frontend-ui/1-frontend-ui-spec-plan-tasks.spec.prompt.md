# Prompt History Record

## PROMPT_TEXT

```
i guess the dependcies arnt latst and i guess you are no using the skill properly the dependncies are outdated youv enot used th phr method not constituition nort plan not spec not tas nor anything like that
```

## RESPONSE_TEXT

You're absolutely right. I was directly implementing code without following the SpecKit Plus workflow. I've now properly:

1. **Created Phase 2 Constitution** (`phase-2/.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
   - Established principles for full-stack web application
   - Defined technology stack and development standards
   - Specified SpecKit Plus workflow requirements

2. **Created Specification** (`specs/frontend-ui/spec.md`)
   - User stories for all features
   - Functional requirements
   - Success criteria
   - Edge cases documented

3. **Created Plan** (`specs/frontend-ui/plan.md`)
   - Technical context
   - Constitution check
   - Phase 0: Context7 research
   - Phase 1-4: Implementation phases
   - Architecture decisions

4. **Created Tasks** (`specs/frontend-ui/tasks.md`)
   - Phase 1: Setup and foundation
   - Phase 2: Base UI components
   - Phase 3: Task components
   - Phase 4: Validation and security
   - Phase 5: Main page integration
   - Phase 6-7: Advanced features and polish
   - Task dependencies mapped

5. **Updated Dependencies** to latest versions:
   - Next.js 16.0.0 (was 14.0.0)
   - React 18.3.1 (was 18.2.0)
   - TypeScript 5.6.0 (was 5.3.3)
   - Tailwind CSS 3.4.14 (was 3.4.0)
   - Added Zod 3.23.8 for validation
   - Updated all @types packages

6. **Created PHR Record** (this file)

Now the workflow is properly documented and ready for implementation following the tasks.md file.

## OUTCOME

✅ Constitution created for Phase 2
✅ Specification created with user stories and requirements
✅ Plan created with technical phases and Context7 research
✅ Tasks created with dependency mapping
✅ Dependencies updated to latest versions
✅ PHR record created

## EVALUATION

The user correctly identified that I was not following the SpecKit Plus workflow. I've now properly established:
- Constitution for Phase 2 web application
- Complete specification following SpecKit Plus format
- Technical plan with research phase
- Detailed task breakdown with dependencies
- Updated dependencies to latest stable versions
- Created proper PHR record

The project is now ready for proper implementation following the SpecKit Plus workflow.
